        <p>The Office is an American television sitcom that depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. It aired on NBC from March 24, 2005, to May 16, 2013, lasting a
            total of nine seasons.[1] It is an adaptation of the original BBC series of the same name and was adapted for American television by Greg Daniels, a veteran writer for Saturday Night Live, King of the Hill, and The Simpsons. It was co-produced
            by Daniels' Deedle-Dee Productions, and Reveille Productions (later Shine America), in association with Universal Television. The original executive producers were Daniels, Howard Klein, Ben Silverman, Ricky Gervais, and Stephen Merchant,
            with numerous others being promoted in later seasons.
        </p>
        <p>To simulate the look of an actual documentary it was filmed in a single-camera setup without a studio audience or a laugh track. The series debuted on NBC as a mid-season replacement and aired 201 episodes over the course of its run. The Office
            originally featured Steve Carell, Rainn Wilson, John Krasinski, Jenna Fischer, and B. J. Novak as the main cast, however, the series experienced numerous changes to its ensemble cast during its run. Notable stars outside the original main
            cast include Ed Helms, Mindy Kaling, Craig Robinson, James Spader, and Ellie Kemper</p>
        <p>The Office was met with mixed reviews during its short first season, but the following several seasons received acclaim from television critics. These seasons were included on several critics' year-end top TV series lists, winning several awards
            such as a Peabody Award in 2006, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, a Golden Globe Award for Carell's performance, and four Primetime Emmy Awards, including one for Outstanding Comedy Series in 2006. Later seasons were criticized for a decline
            in quality, with many seeing Carell's departure in season seven as a contributing factor. However, the final season ended the series' run with a generally positive response. The series finale was viewed by an estimated 5.69 million viewers,
            following by an hour-long series retrospective.</p>

            the food industry. You write your sandwich on it.” – Dwight Schrute</p>

            <h2><b>About  Munder Difflin Paper Co</b></h2>
            <p>This US adaptation, set at a paper company in Scranton, Pa., has a similar documentary style to that of the Ricky Gervais-led British original. It features the staff of Dunder-Mifflin, a staff that includes characters based on characters from
                the British show (and, quite possibly, people you work with in your office) There's Jim, the likable employee who's a bit of an everyman. Jim has a thing for receptionist-turned-sales rep Pam (because office romances are always a good
                idea). There's also Dwight, the successful co-worker who lacks social skills an common sense. And there's Ryan, who has held many jobs at the company.</p>
